# XiangQi.js

## Description

XiangQi boards into websites. To learn more about it, go to its
landing page:
https://xiangqijs.herokuapp.com/

## Basic Setup

First, download the library files and unzip the files to
your desired location.
 
Since XiangQi.js uses no external API, to use the XiangQi.js API, 
simply load the JavaScript file and CSS file into the web page:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path-to-xiangqi.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path-to-xiangqi.css">
```

Make sure to also include the assets folder that contains various content used
by XiangQi.js under the same directory as the library files. And that should be it!
Read the API Doc to see various configurations and API
functions that XiangQi.js provides, or read examples page to see sample of API usage.
